ActiveMQ:
ActiveMQ is the most popular and powerful open source messaging and Integration patterns server.
JMS is only an API specification, not an implementation. You need a piece of software that implements the JMS API if you want to do something with message queues.
JMS is a specification. JMS has three main parts to it. The first is the producer, which is nothing more than a bean that submits a "message" to a JMS broker (#2) (the system that manages messages between producers and consumers). In this case, ActiveMQ is the broker. Once the broker receives a message, the consumer (#3), or Message-Driven Bean (MDB), processes the message.

ActiveMQ is a message broker which implements the JMS API. Besides ActiveMQ there are many other products that implement the JMS API.
A message broker (also known as an integration broker or interface engine[1]) is an intermediary computer program module that translates a message from the formal messaging protocol of the sender to the formal messaging protocol of the receiver.
